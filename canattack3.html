                <h1>Written Response</h1>
                <p>Working at the beginner level on App Inventor both my partner and I ran into some issues in the creation of our app. For example, one issue that we encountered was the positioning of the can sprites. The issue was that whenever the android device went to sleep and powered back on the can sprites changed x positions. To fix this issue, we added a procedure that corrected the alignment of the cans for whatever situation. Within the procedure was an equation that centered all three can sprites in the middle of the canvas. One difference between the first and third can sprite was that one sprite was translated several units to the left and the other was translated several units to the right. This spaced all three cans a couple units away from each other so they could be visible to the player. 
                Another difficulty that came to our attention was that our screens were not displaying in the correct order. Our initial intention was to get screen one to display the branding screen and then five seconds later the game canvas would take over the screen. To sum up, we had a block of code that when screen one initialized the canvas would be set invisible. Unfortunately, the app displayed the opposite of its intended effect. When the app initialized, the main game displayed for about a millisecond and then it went to the branding screen to the game canvas again. Since the code itself was not an issue we checked the designer and canvas one was checked so it could be set to visible. Removing the check from canvas one set to visible in designer allowed all the screens to run in appropriate chronological order. 
                One thing that I worked on independently was some of the graphics. I designed the main menu screen by putting several images together on google slides and taking a screenshot of it in the end. I also took some clipart of soda cans online and added faces to them with the use of Microsoft Paint. I also added combinations of images from the internet to create the field background used in the main game with google slides.
