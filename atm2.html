               <h2>Video Response</h2>
               <p>In this video, I demonstrate how to create a new account on our text-based ATM program created using Python. At the start of running the program, I am presented with a welcome message. Then, I am asked to input “old” if I have an account or “new” if I don’t have an account. In this case, I don’t have an account so I type in new. Now I am asked to input my name. After I enter my name, I am greeted by the program and I am prompted to deposit some money. I deposit 2100 dollars into my account. After that, I am given several options, I have the option to check my balance, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money, and exit to log out. I type in deposit and add 500 dollars to my current balance. Then, to make sure my balance updated from my initial balance I type balance. My balance shows that I now have 2600 on my account, therefore, it updated successfully. Now I decided that I want to take out some money. In order to do that, I enter withdraw and I am asked how much I want to withdraw. I enter 300 and just to double check I enter balance again to see if my balance was updated. The program tells me that I now have 2300 dollars so that means that the program worked properly. Now I decided that I want to transfer some money and to do that I enter transfer as input. All I need to do now is enter the name of the person I want to transfer money to. I enter Landfried and I am asked how much I want to transfer to Landfried.  I enter 1000 and I am told that the money was transferred to Landfried's account successfully. I am also told that I have 1300 left on my account. Now I am finished making the transactions I wanted to make, I log out by typing in “exit”. Now everyone else is free to login to their own account.</p>
